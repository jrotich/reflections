When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When collaborating with other people or using a different machine. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When a repository is public, and multiple people are working on the repository, 
you might want to just pull after a logical commit has been done by others. 
Additionally, you can be more aware of conflicts when a manual pull is done. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies of repositories done on the github website
Clones are copies of repositories from github or the local machine. 
Branches are just diversions from the master. 

You fork on the github website when you don't have rights to modify the original repository.
Clone to local machine or another local directory.
Branch when you want to do experimental work that you are not confident pushing to the main.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
